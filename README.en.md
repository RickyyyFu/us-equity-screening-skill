# US equity screening · v2.2.1

Documentation and package updated: 2026-10-04. Research rules last updated: 2026-10-02. Independently maintained. [中文](README.md)

## Purpose and scope
Screen research candidates within an explicit market, sector, theme or stock universe, with coverage auditing and exclusion reasons.

Candidate screening only; no automatic full company research or invocation of another skill. A research handoff is a human workflow, not a runtime dependency.

## Use a ZIP package (no Git required)

1. [Download the ZIP package](downloads/us-equity-screening-v2.2.1.zip?raw=true) for the current packaged version. **Code → Download ZIP** downloads the entire repository instead.
2. Upload it to an agent that can extract ZIP archives and read the bundled files.
3. Paste this instruction and replace the task at the end:

```text
Extract the uploaded skill archive, read us-equity-screening/SKILL.md in the extracted package, and confirm the skill name is us-equity-screening. Read the references required by the entry point and use the assets templates to complete the task. First confirm that you can access the bundled files; explicitly report any extraction or reading limitation. Mark missing data UNKNOWN/LIMITED and do not invent data.
Task: Screen research candidates from my supplied US equity universe; disclose coverage and missing inputs, then provide candidate cards and exclusions.
```

The standalone ZIP extracts to `us-equity-screening/`, with `us-equity-screening/SKILL.md` as its entry point. **Code → Download ZIP** downloads the entire repository, usually under `us-equity-screening-skill-main/`, with SKILL.md at that repository root and additional maintenance files such as downloads/. Prefer the versioned skill ZIP for installation.

If ZIP extraction is unavailable, extract locally and upload the required files where supported, preserving entry-point, references, and assets relationships, or place the complete skill folder in the host's supported skill directory. SKILL.md alone omits required rules and templates.

An attachment lets the agent follow the bundled rules for the current task; it does not necessarily install a persistent skill. Live research requires web access, authorized data sources, or user-provided data. The package includes no market data service, credentials, or subscription.

## Local installation (requires host skill support)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RickyyyFu/us-equity-screening-skill.git us-equity-screening
```
Place the entire cloned directory in your host's configured skill location or load its root SKILL.md through the host's local skill mechanism. Preserve all relative references, assets, scripts and tests; do not copy only SKILL.md. The host determines the loading location. No credentials, data subscription or trading service are included.

## Usage
Example request:

> Screen research candidates from my supplied US equity universe; disclose coverage and missing inputs, then provide candidate cards and exclusions.

Read [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) and required references, then use the assets templates. Adapt `assets/config.example.json` and `assets/evidence-ledger.example.json` in a working copy; examples are not market data. The host supplies authorized sources.

## Methodology
Coverage audit → business quality and key contradictions → valuation and catalysts → two-sided crowding risk → technical overlay (including DMI/ADX confirmation) → candidate cards and exclusions. Usually 3–8 candidates; fewer or none are valid. News-only discovery is labeled lead_discovery.

DMI/ADX is a technical confirmation layer: +DI/-DI describe direction while ADX describes strength. Rising ADX does not mean price is rising, and DI crossovers are never standalone trade or ranking signals.

Positioning / Crowding / Squeeze is a path-risk overlay, not a replacement for quality or valuation. High SI is Fuel, not automatically a Trigger or buy ranking. Record sources, timestamps, counterevidence, triggers and invalidation conditions.

## Data and risk boundaries
Research methods and conditional models, not personalized investment advice. No broker connection, automatic trading or background service. Financials, prices, Short Interest, borrow and options data come from authorized host sources. Missing inputs are UNKNOWN/LIMITED, never zero or fabricated market-wide coverage. Short Interest is distinct from daily Short Volume. 13F is delayed and omits complete hedges; GEX is a model, not a dealer ledger; Call OI does not prove new bullish positions. Crowding does not automatically change DCF or long-term margins. Transaction anchors are not hard floors; 1−Delta is not an option loss probability. Passing tests does not establish excess returns.

## Version maintenance
Default branch: `main`. Use independent semantic versions; synchronize SKILL.md metadata, README, CHANGELOG and MIGRATION when changing versions. Review changes through branches and PRs; after validation, tag the intended commit with `vX.Y.Z` and publish a Release. Do not casually move published tags. `shared_rules_version` labels bundled rules, not an external runtime dependency. The current distribution version is v2.2.1; research rules last changed on 2026-10-02. This release corrects documentation only.

## Tests
Python 3; standard library only. Run from repository root:
```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python scripts/validate_bundle.py
```
Historical migration output: `tests/migration-test-results.txt` and `tests/migration-validation-results.txt`. Run the commands above to validate the current version. Tests verify documentation contracts and bundle integrity, not host execution, live data or investment performance. See [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md).

## Provenance
Complete directory copied from [GammaLens](https://github.com/RickyyyFu/GammaLens/tree/2c2de5790f93a698b25b31660bc5c5fe1ea97dbe/skills/us-equity-screening), branch `feat/equity-research-skills-v1`, commit `2c2de5790f93a698b25b31660bc5c5fe1ea97dbe`, into the new repository root. The migration retained the source directory and added repository documentation and checks. Subsequent changes are recorded in CHANGELOG; the provenance manifest describes the migration snapshot, not current file hashes. See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) and MIGRATION-PROVENANCE.json. GammaLens remains unchanged.

## Maintaining versioned ZIP packages

`downloads/` stores standalone versioned skill ZIPs. The initial package uses the existing skill version. When bundled rules, templates, scripts, or documentation change, bump the version in SKILL.md and synchronize both READMEs, CHANGELOG, and MIGRATION. Update both download links, run `python scripts/validate_bundle.py`, then `python scripts/package_skill.py` from the repository root. Commit the new ZIP with the source and documentation, and verify its download link and extracted contents.

Published ZIPs are immutable: retain historical versions and never overwrite an existing version with different content. The packaging script verifies every bundled file and rejects conflicting same-version packages. Include no private data, credentials, or generated research results.
