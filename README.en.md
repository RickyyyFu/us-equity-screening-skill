# US equity screening · v2.1.0

Updated: 2026-10-02. Independently maintained. [中文](README.md)

## Purpose and scope
Screen research candidates within an explicit market, sector, theme or stock universe, with coverage auditing and exclusion reasons.

Candidate screening only; no automatic full company research or invocation of another skill. A research handoff is a human workflow, not a runtime dependency.

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RickyyyFu/us-equity-screening-skill.git us-equity-screening
```
Place the entire cloned directory in your host's configured skill location or load its root SKILL.md through the host's local skill mechanism. Preserve all relative references, assets, scripts and tests; do not copy only SKILL.md. The host determines the loading location. No credentials, data subscription or trading service are included.

## Usage
Example request:

> Screen research candidates from my supplied US equity universe; disclose coverage and missing inputs, then provide candidate cards and exclusions.

Read [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) and required references, then use the assets templates. Adapt `assets/config.example.json` and `assets/evidence-ledger.example.json` in a working copy; examples are not market data. The host supplies authorized sources.

## Methodology
Coverage audit → business quality and key contradictions → valuation and catalysts → two-sided crowding risk → technical overlay → candidate cards and exclusions. Usually 3–8 candidates; fewer or none are valid. News-only discovery is labeled lead_discovery.

Positioning / Crowding / Squeeze is a path-risk overlay, not a replacement for quality or valuation. High SI is Fuel, not automatically a Trigger or buy ranking. Record sources, timestamps, counterevidence, triggers and invalidation conditions.

## Data and risk boundaries
Research methods and conditional models, not personalized investment advice. No broker connection, automatic trading or background service. Financials, prices, Short Interest, borrow and options data come from authorized host sources. Missing inputs are UNKNOWN/LIMITED, never zero or fabricated market-wide coverage. Short Interest is distinct from daily Short Volume. 13F is delayed and omits complete hedges; GEX is a model, not a dealer ledger; Call OI does not prove new bullish positions. Crowding does not automatically change DCF or long-term margins. Transaction anchors are not hard floors; 1−Delta is not an option loss probability. Passing tests does not establish excess returns.

## Version maintenance
Default branch: `main`. Use independent semantic versions; synchronize SKILL.md metadata, README, CHANGELOG and MIGRATION when changing versions. Review changes through branches and PRs; after validation, tag the intended commit with `vX.Y.Z` and publish a Release. Do not casually move published tags. `shared_rules_version` labels bundled rules, not an external runtime dependency. This migration preserves v2.1.0 and the 2026-10-02 rule update date.

## Tests
Python 3; standard library only. Run from repository root:
```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python scripts/validate_bundle.py
```
Recorded output: `tests/migration-test-results.txt` and `tests/migration-validation-results.txt`. Tests verify documentation contracts and bundle integrity, not host execution, live data or investment performance. See [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md).
